                    <p>The purpose of this blog post is to demonstrate my ability in using HTML and CSS to create this page layout. However, I actually need content to fill this blog post, and can't just leave empty space. To solve this, I've decided to write about the current team I am using for competitive matches in Pokemon Sword's online multiplayer.</p>
                    <h2>Miltank</h2>
                    <img src="../images/miltank.gif" class="pokemon"><br>
                    <p>Miltank is primarily a support player for the team. It utilizes its high speed to quickly hit the opponent with Icy Wind and apply a debuff to them, or it supports its ally with the move Helping Hand and allows them to deal more damage. </p>
                    <h2>Zacian</h2>
                    <img src="../images/zacian.gif" class="pokemon"><br>
                    <p>Zacian's role in the team relies on its monstrous attack stat. Zacian's power, when supported by Miltank, is enough to take out most opponent's pokemon in one attack.</p>
                    <h2>Cradily</h2>
                    <img src="../images/cradily.gif" class="pokemon"><br>
                    <p>Cradily serves as a defensive player in the team, and is able to tank many attacks. With its high defense stats, Cradily is able to protect its teammates from being threatened.</p>
